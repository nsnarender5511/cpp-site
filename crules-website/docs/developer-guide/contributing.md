# Contributing to cursor++

> 🤝 Guidelines for contributing to cursor++.

## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to cursor++! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project. By following these guidelines, you help maintain the quality and consistency of the codebase.

## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md). We expect all contributors to adhere to these guidelines to ensure a positive and inclusive environment for everyone.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Git

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cursor++.git
   cd cursor++
   ```
3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/nsnarender5511/cursor++.git
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: The primary branch containing stable code
- `develop`: The development branch for ongoing work
- Feature branches: Create from `develop` with the format `feature/your-feature-name`
- Bugfix branches: Create from `develop` with the format `bugfix/issue-description`

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Ensure you're on the develop branch
git checkout develop

# Pull the latest changes
git pull upstream develop

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Changes

When making changes:

1. Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) for style guidance
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Ensure your code passes all existing tests
4. Update documentation as needed

### Running Tests

Run tests with:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

### Committing Changes

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types include:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or tools

Example:
```
feat(agent): add support for selection by index
```

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Open a pull request against the `develop` branch of the original repository
3. Fill out the pull request template with all required information
4. Wait for the CI checks to pass
5. Address any feedback from reviewers

## Coding Standards

### Go Formatting

- Use `gofmt` or `goimports` to format your code
- Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) guidelines

### Code Organization

- Keep packages focused and cohesive
- Use descriptive names for packages, types, and functions
- Organize imports in groups: standard library, external dependencies, internal packages

### Documentation

- Document all exported types, functions, and methods
- Add examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation up-to-date when changing code

### Documentation Contributions

#### Documentation Structure
- All documentation is located in the `docs/` directory
- User-facing documentation is in `docs/user-guide/`
- Developer documentation is in `docs/developer-guide/`
- API reference is in `docs/api-reference/`
- Examples are in `docs/examples/`

#### Documentation Standards
- Use Markdown for all documentation files
- Include version indicators at the top of each documentation file:
  ```markdown
  ---
  version: v0.1.0
  last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
  applies_to: cursor++ v0.1.0+
  ---
  ```
- Include a table of contents for files longer than 100 lines
- Use relative links for cross-references within documentation
- Provide code examples for technical concepts
- Add visual elements (diagrams, screenshots) for complex ideas
- Use consistent formatting across all documentation files
- Follow the structure of existing documentation for new files

#### Documentation Testing
- Verify all links are valid before submitting documentation changes
- Ensure code examples are up-to-date with the current API
- Test documentation rendering in GitHub to ensure proper formatting
- Verify that all referenced files and images exist
- Check for spelling and grammatical errors

#### Documentation Workflow
1. Identify documentation gaps or improvements
2. Create a branch for your documentation changes
3. Make your changes following the documentation standards
4. Test your changes as described above
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes

### Error Handling

- Always check errors
- Use descriptive error messages
- Wrap errors with additional context using `fmt.Errorf("failed to do something: %w", err)`
- Define custom error types for specific error conditions

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functions and methods
- Aim for high test coverage (at least 80%)
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock dependencies to test edge cases and error conditions
