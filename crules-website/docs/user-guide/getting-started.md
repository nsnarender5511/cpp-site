# Getting Started with cursor++

> 🚀 This guide will help you get up and running with cursor++ quickly, showing you how to set up your environment, initialize projects, and work with agents.

## Overview

Cursor++ is a command-line tool that simplifies the management of Cursor rules across multiple projects. It solves several key challenges:

- **Centralized Rule Management**: Maintain all your AI agent rules in one main location
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Ensure all projects have the latest versions of your rules
- **Consistent AI Experience**: Create a uniform AI agent experience across all your projects
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Share rules with team members easily

## Installation

If you haven't installed cursor++ yet, follow the [Installation Guide](./installation.md) for step-by-step instructions.

Quick installation options:

```bash
# Using Homebrew (macOS)
brew install cursor++

# Manual installation
curl -sL https://github.com/org/cursor++/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

Verify your installation:

```bash
cursor++ --version
```

## Basic Usage

### Initial Setup

When you first use cursor++, you'll need to set up your main rules location. This is where all your rules will be centrally managed.

```bash
# Initialize rules in the current project
cursor++ init
```

The first time you run this command, you'll be guided through setting up your main rules location. Options include:

1. Creating an empty directory structure
2. Fetching rules from a git repository
3. Importing rules from a URL

> **Note**: Rules are searched for in multiple locations in this order:
> 1. Your current project's directory (`.cursor/rules`)
> 2. Your home directory (`~/.cursor/rules`)
> 3. The system-wide location (`/usr/local/share/cursor-rules`)
>
> This ensures that rules are found regardless of where they are stored, making the system more reliable and flexible.

```

> **New in v1.2**: When cloning from a Git repository with multiple folders, the system will now clone the entire repository to the agents directory but only copy files from a specific subfolder (default: "default") to your rules directory. This allows repository maintainers to organize different sets of agents in separate folders.

### Project Management

Once your main rules location is set up, you can initialize rules in any project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
cursor++ init
```

This will:
1. Copy rules from your main location to the current project
2. Register the project in the cursor++ registry
3. Update your `.gitignore` to exclude the `.cursor/` directory

View all registered projects:

```bash
cursor++ list
```

Clean up non-existent projects:

```bash
cursor++ clean
```

### Rule Synchronization

To ensure your project has the latest rules from your main location:

```bash
cursor++ sync
```

When you've made changes to rules in your project that you want to share:

```bash
cursor++ merge
```

This will:
1. Copy your local rules to the main location
2. Synchronize the changes to all registered projects

## Working with Agents

### Listing Available Agents

To see all available agents:

```bash
cursor++ agent
```

This will display a formatted table of all agents with their information.

### Agent Selection

To interactively select and load an agent:

```bash
cursor++ agent select
```

This will present a menu of available agents. Use the arrow keys to navigate, then press Enter to select.

### Getting Agent Information

To view detailed information about a specific agent:

```bash
cursor++ agent info <id>
```

Replace `<id>` with either:
- The agent's string ID (e.g., `wizard`)
- The agent's numeric index from the list (e.g., `1`)

## Importing Agents

You can import agent rules from a URL:

```bash
cursor++ import https://cursor.directory/example-agent
```

This will:
1. Fetch the content from the URL
2. Parse the content to extract rules
3. Store the rules in your main location
4. Optionally store them in your current project if it has a rules directory

## Common Workflows

### Setting Up a New Project

```bash
# Create a new project directory
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Initialize rules
cursor++ init

# Start using agents in your project
cursor++ agent select
```

### Creating Custom Agents

1. Create a new `.mdc` file in your main rules location
2. Define your agent with the appropriate metadata and instructions
3. Use `cursor++ merge` to share it with all your projects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Rules not syncing**: Ensure your main location is properly set up and accessible
- **Agent not found**: Check that the agent ID is correct and the file exists in your rules directory
- **Permission errors**: Verify you have write access to the relevant directories

If you encounter persistent issues, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md) for more detailed solutions.
