# Make it executable
chmod +x cursor++

# Move it to a directory in your PATH
sudo mv cursor++ /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Linux

```bash

# Move it to a directory in your PATH
Move-Item -Path cursor++.exe -Destination "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\"
```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cursor-ai/cursor-plus-plus.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd cursor-plus-plus
   ```
4. Build the binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o cursor++ ./cmd
   ```
5. Install it:
